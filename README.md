# Python-Beginner-Projects
Will be uploading projects as I learn the python programming language.


- Hangman-Python_Begginer_Project

  Hangman.py: This program is to practice the use of loops, conditionals, variables, reading files, and functions.
  Program takes in a random word from randomWords.txt and asks the user to guess each word.
  The user has 6 tries to guess the correct word.
  If the user gets a letter wrong then the wrong_counter will increment and the program will come to an end at 6 incorrect tries.
  If the user enters a correct word more than once then the program will promt the user to try again and wont trigger the correct_counter.
 
 -Rock_Paper_Scissors.py
 
  This program is a quicl simulation of the game rock paper scissors. I explored the use of dictionaries in creating this small project. Makes use of a loop and conditionals in order to win or loose the game. Also has an exit if the user wishes to not play anymore.
